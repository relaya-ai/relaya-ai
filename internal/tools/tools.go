// Package tools is the registry of third-party CLIs that `everyapi use` knows how to point at EveryAPI. Adding a tool here is a single map entry — no changes elsewhere.
//
// Each entry describes:
//   - ExecName: the binary that gets exec'd (looked up in $PATH)
//   - Env: the environment variables to set so the tool talks to the EveryAPI gateway. URLs are computed at runtime by appending the tool-specific suffix to the user's configured API base, so a local-dev base (http://localhost:8787) works without per-tool env edits.
//   - InstallHint: copy printed when ExecName isn't on PATH
//
// The env-var conventions are read straight off each tool's docs (see the comment on the entry). When upstream renames a variable we update one line here.

// Tool describes how to launch one third-party CLI against EveryAPI.
type Tool struct {
	Name        string
	ExecName    string
	InstallHint string
	// DefaultArgs are used only when the caller supplied no tool arguments. Keep these compile-time literals: they reach exec directly, without a shell. An explicit argument list always wins.
	DefaultArgs []string

	// Native launches a client that owns its own authentication and upstream routing. Use must not resolve or expose an EveryAPI relay key for it.
	Native bool

	// InstallCmd is the shell command 'everyapi use' offers to run on the user's behalf when ExecName isn't on $PATH. Executed via `sh -c` on Unix and `cmd /C` on Windows; an empty value disables the auto-install prompt and the user falls back to reading InstallHint and running the installer themselves. For tools whose canonical installer is Unix-only (e.g. a `curl | bash` script), InstallCmdUnixOnly should be true so Windows users see the hint instead of a guaranteed-to-fail shell pipeline.
	//
	// SECURITY INVARIANT: this string MUST be a compile-time literal embedded in the Registry below. It is passed verbatim to `sh -c` / `cmd /C` with no escaping — sourcing it from user input, env vars, config files, or any network response would be RCE. If you find yourself wanting to make this dynamic, design a per-tool installer function instead.
	//
	// TIMEOUT INVARIANT: every curl that fetches from a vendor origin (the primary source in a `primary || dl.everyapi.ai mirror` chain) MUST carry `--connect-timeout 5`. Without it, a vendor host that blackholes TCP — the normal case for claude.ai, raw.githubusercontent.com, and astral.sh from mainland China — makes curl wait out the OS default connect timeout (~75s on macOS) before the `||` hands over to the mirror, and the user sees a frozen installer rather than a fallback. Match install.sh, which already hardens every fetch this way.
	//
	// Only --connect-timeout is safe here. Do NOT add --max-time or --speed-limit to a `curl | sh` stage: curl blocks writing into the pipe once the script exceeds the ~64 KiB pipe buffer (astral.sh/uv/install.sh is ~71 KiB), so a wall-clock or throughput bound would kill installers that are running normally. --connect-timeout only bounds TCP/TLS setup, which completes before the first pipe write.
	InstallCmd string
	// InstallCmdWindows overrides InstallCmd on Windows when the vendor publishes a separate native installer command. The first element is the executable and the rest are passed as argv directly, never through cmd.exe. It has the same security invariant as InstallCmd and every element must remain a compile-time literal.
	InstallCmdWindows []string
	// InstallCmdUnixOnly gates InstallCmd off on Windows when the command relies on a POSIX-only pipeline (curl | bash, etc.). Doubles as the "this installer is less reversible than `npm install -g`" signal: prompt callers default to N when this is true, so a single press of Enter never runs a remote shell script on the user's machine.
	InstallCmdUnixOnly bool

	// ExtraBinDirs lists installer-specific directories to search for ExecName when $PATH misses, as $HOME-relative paths ("" segments and absolute paths are ignored). The npm-global fallback in resolveExecDirs only covers `npm install -g` tools; an installer that writes somewhere else — Antigravity's install.sh drops `agy` into ~/.local/bin — needs its own candidates, or a user whose shell adds that dir in an rc file everyapi never sources stays permanently "not installed" and loops on reinstall offers.
	//
	// Same contract as InstallCmd: compile-time literals only. These paths are joined onto the user's home dir and stat'd, never executed as shell text, but keeping them static preserves the "no user input reaches tool resolution" property.
	ExtraBinDirs []string
	// WindowsLocalAppDataBinDirs lists installer-owned directories beneath %LOCALAPPDATA%. It closes the same install-then-resolve loop as ExtraBinDirs for Windows installers that use the platform convention.
	WindowsLocalAppDataBinDirs []string

	// YoloFlag is the tool-specific "skip every confirmation" argument the user might want to pass — claude's --dangerously-skip-permissions, codex's --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox, gemini's --yolo. 'everyapi use' offers the flag via a TTY confirm prompt before exec so the user can opt in without having to remember the exact string. Empty for tools where no such blanket-bypass flag exists.
	YoloFlag string
	// YoloLabel is the human-readable name shown in the prompt: "Enable <YoloLabel>? [y/N]". Should be short and reflect what the user gets — "skip permission prompts (claude)" / "bypass approvals + sandbox (codex)" / "yolo mode (gemini)".
	YoloLabel string
	// YoloEnv is the env-var form of the blanket-bypass switch, for tools whose "skip every confirmation" mode is toggled by an environment variable rather than an argv flag — hermes reads HERMES_YOLO_MODE=1 and exposes no equivalent command-line flag. When set and the user opts in at the prompt, 'everyapi use' puts this var = "1" in the tool's env instead of (or in addition to) prepending YoloFlag. A tool may set YoloFlag, YoloEnv, or both; empty when the tool has no blanket-bypass switch at all.
	YoloEnv string

	// FlagProbeArgs is an argv tail that makes this tool parse its command line, report the result through its exit code, and then do nothing else — codex's `exec --help` prints usage and exits 0 without starting a session, reading stdin, or firing hooks.
	//
	// It enables FlagProbe (see flagprobe.go), which runs the tool once with a candidate flag prepended to decide whether adding that flag would abort the launch. That question only has an empirical answer: the binary on $PATH may be a wrapper that prepends flags of its own, and a flag the tool declares non-repeatable then arrives twice.
	//
	// SAFETY CONTRACT: these args must be observably inert — no session, no stdin read, no network, no writes, no hooks. They run on every launch of a tool that declares them. Same compile-time-literal rule as InstallCmd and ExtraBinDirs. Empty disables probing entirely, which means every flag EveryAPI wants to add is added unexamined.
	FlagProbeArgs []string

	// ModelEnv names the env var the tool's prepareFn reads to pin the upstream model. Set only for tools that don't carry their own vendor-default model and therefore need EveryAPI to choose one — Hermes reads EVERYAPI_HERMES_MODEL, Qwen Code reads OPENAI_MODEL, Gemini, Aider, Goose, Crush, Cline, and OpenClaw use the same contract through their preparation hooks. When non-empty, 'everyapi use' offers a model picker (populated from the gateway's model catalog) before launch and honors a `--model <id>` flag. Empty for claude/codex/grok, whose own CLIs default the model and route it by name through the gateway.
	ModelEnv string

	// RequiredEndpoint, when non-empty, is the relay endpoint type this client's wire protocol requires. `everyapi use` checks the live model catalog before launch so a client cannot enter its own retry loop when every available model explicitly lacks that protocol bridge.
	RequiredEndpoint string
	// AlternativeEndpoint, when non-empty, is a second wire protocol the client can drive. Models supporting either endpoint are launchable.
	AlternativeEndpoint string

	// envFn builds the env vars from the resolved API base + access token. Returns a map[name]value to merge into os.Environ before exec. Implemented as a function (not a static map) because the per-tool URL suffix varies (some take a v1 prefix, some don't).

	// prepareFn is an optional pre-exec hook for tools that need more than env vars — e.g. codex, whose router is pinned by `~/.codex/config.toml` (model_provider) and whose auth_mode is pinned by `~/.codex/auth.json` (apikey vs chatgpt). Returning a non-nil env map merges those vars on top of envFn's output (last write wins), letting the hook redirect CODEX_HOME at a generated config dir. Nil means the tool needs no pre-exec setup beyond env vars.

Unlike claude/gemini, hermes does NOT read OPENAI_BASE_URL for its main model — config.yaml is the single source of truth for the endpoint, and OPENAI_API_KEY is only consulted when base_url's host is openai.com (so it never attaches for an EveryAPI host). So all routing goes through a generated config.yaml under an isolated HERMES_HOME (see hermes.go): provider=custom pins hermes at <apiBase>/v1, with the relay key inlined as model.api_key. envFn therefore sets nothing — HERMES_HOME comes from prepareFn.
